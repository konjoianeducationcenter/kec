                    <div class="m-b container-fluid">They [definitely] helped me in algebra during sophomore year. It was 1 on 1 tutoring and my grades went up a lot because of it. I actually looked forward to going here and it made me a lot more comfortable participating in class. My SAT scores were 700 something in math. I wouldn't have gotten the algebra answers correct if it was for the Konjoian learning center.
